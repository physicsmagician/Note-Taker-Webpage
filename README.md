# Note-Taker-Webpage
I designed webpages to write my lecture content to better familiarize the concepts and to save paper. I have also made webpages for assignments rather than going with the traditional Microsoft Word document to complete themm

DEVELOPMENT:
Before migrating to the world of online notes, I started out by putting my notes onto a webpage using HTML and CSS on Brackets. Since I wasn't taking any courses that 
taught these languages, it was up to me to learn them on my own. I learned about CSS design patterns and became immersed in front-end design. 
Taking it a step further, I also made my assignments look really nice by visualizing the information in a more elegant way. It really impressed my teacher at the time!

Unfortunately, my documents were corrupted when I moved my files from Mac to Windows. However, I am confident in my ability to program in HTML and CSS as well as pick
up new languages
